The [FDPC-01 kit] is a simple but elegant case based on the "[sick of beige](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Sick_of_Beige_basic_case_v1)" design and is intended to help keep things neat and protected whilst using the Fernvale board. It can be bought from [Ground Electronics](http://groundelectronics.com).

## Repository contents

The case design is provided in the following formats:

* Inkscape SVG (source)

The top and bottom panels are laser cut from 3mm glass look acrylic.
The middle two layers are cut from 5mm grey acrylic.

## Assembly

![Parts laid out](/images/00-allPartsLaidOut-ExceptAcrylic.JPG)

1. Remove the protective plastic from the acrylic panels.

![Boards with header pins added](/images/02-boardsSoldered.JPG)

2. Snap header pins into suitable lengths, using the Fernvale boards for reference. Take care to solder pins in same orientation as in photo.

![Adding M2.5 machine screws](/images/03-acrylicBaseAndM2p5Screws.JPG)

3. Take 5 x M2.5 x 12mm machine screws and insert them into the acrylic base part.

![Adding JTAG FPCB](/images/04-JTAGPluggedIn.JPG)

4. Connect the optional JTAG FPCB to the main Fernvale board, if you wish to use it.

![Adding main board](/images/05-mainBoardOnBase.JPG)

5. Add the main Fernvale board, taking care that all of the M2.5 machine screws go through the mounting holes correctly.

![Adding supplied short spacers](/images/06-spacersOnMainBoard.JPG)

6. Add the M2.5 x 3mm round spacers, supplied with the Fernvale kit, to the main board, on the two machine screws closest to the JTAG breakout FPCB. Take extra care that you select the correct, shorter spacers here.

![Adding GSM board](/images/07-GSMModuleOnMainBoard.JPG)

7. Add the GSM module board, ensuring the connector is lined up before applying suitable pressure to click it into place.

![Adding taller supplied spacers](/images/08-tallerSpacersInPlace.JPG)

8. Add the M2.5 x 4mm round spacers to the remaining three machine screws.

![Adding Base board](/images/09-BladeBoardInPlaceNutsAdded.JPG)

9. Thread / maneuvre the FPCB JTAG breakout through the bottom acrylic layer. Add the Fernvale Blade board, again taking care to align the high density connector before clicking into place. This step can be fiddly and some machine screws may come free!

10. Add the M2.5 hex nuts to the machine screws and tighten, securing the boards in place.

![Adding steel hex spacers](/images/10-M3x10mmSpacersAdded.JPG)

11. Add the four M3 x 10mm steel hex standoffs to the base acrylic part.
